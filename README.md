# bitperfect FastAPI - Pagination Example

This Repository includes an example how to use our lightweight pagination example we've written in detail [here](https://bitperfect.at/en/blog/pagination-mit-fastapi).

The relevant files can be found here:
- [pagination classes](src/types/pagination.py)
- [validators](src/types/validators.py)
- [pagination functions](src/modules/db/pagination.py)

There is an example router included that shows how the functions can be used.

The idea of this pagination method is to be easily extendable and offering high performance for page queries, while still being concise and easy to read and maintain.
